# Bypass-YouTube-Ads
**Tampermonkey Script to Bypass YouTube Ads**

## How it works (The URL Trick)
A simple way to bypass YouTube ads is to insert a hyphen "-" between "`yout`" and "`ube`" in the video URL but you'll can see the video only (no comments, descriptions...). You can test this manually by yourself on any video:

**Original:** `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw`
**Bypass:** `https://www.yout-ube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw`

**This script automates the process for you.**

## Script Features
When you click on a video, this script optimizes your experience by managing two tabs simultaneously:

1.  **The Original Tab (Context & Comments):**
    The standard YouTube page stays open. This allows you to read the **comments**, check the **description**, and browse **suggested videos**.
    * *Smart Feature:* The script **automatically pauses and mutes** the video on this tab immediately. You get the context without the noise, and you don't have to lift a finger to stop it.

2.  **The New Tab (Ad-Free Viewing):**
    A second tab opens automatically with the modified `yout-ube.com` link.
    * This provides a **full-screen, ad-free player**.
    * It isolates the content: you get access strictly to the video—no sidebar, no distractions, and most importantly, **no ads**.
